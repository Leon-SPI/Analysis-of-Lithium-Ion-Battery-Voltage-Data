# Analysis of Lithium Ion Battery Voltage Data
This repo contains analysis of lithium ion battery data. The data set was acquired from "https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Randomized-and-Recommissioned-Battery-Dataset/xg3n-ngei/about_data" with credit being given to the Probabilistic Mechanics Lab, University of Central Florida. The data set contains voltage information for many different lithium ion batteries. These batteries were subjected to rapid aging at constant and variable loads. For more information, please visit the link above and read the "Dataset Original README" for more information directly from the Probabilistic Mechanics Lab. 

The analysis answers the general questions stated below, relating to lithium-ion batteries.

Question 1: How does a battery's voltage relate over time?

Question 2: How does a battery's temperature relate to load current?

Question 3: How does a battery's voltage relate to load current?

# Requirements
The list of requirements are in the "Requirements.txt" file. It is recommended to use pip install.

To better visualize the raw data, it is recommented to have "Microsoft Excel".

# Main Programs Written To Analyze The Data

There are three main programs which answer the topic questions. 

"FinalQuestion1.py" answers question 1.

 This is an analysis of a dataset where lituium ion batteries were rapidly aged


The repo should include a README on the main page outlining:

The general/topic and challenge the code addresses
A list of any required dependencies and additional programs
The main programs written to analyze the data
A tutorial/walkthrough of how to operate the code
A sample of results from the analysis
Any limitations on running the program
A brief discussion of future results.
